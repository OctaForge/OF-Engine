Note that this license is an extension of the original Sauerbraten source 
code license which is included under the file "readme_sauerbraten.txt" for
reference. Both are essentially the ZLIB license, but the Tesseract license 
may include differing copyright owners and usage clarifications.

LICENSE NOTES
=============
The license covers the source code found in the "src" directory of this

ENet network library which Tesseract uses is covered by an MIT-style 
license, which is however compatible with the above license for all 
practical purposes.

Other media included with this distribution (maps, textures, sounds, models etc.)
are NOT covered by this license, and may have individual copyrights and
distribution restrictions (see individual readmes).
