For installation, read **INSTALL.md**.

To run it, launch `bin_unix/client_YOUROS_YOURARCH` on Unix-like operating systems
and `bin_winYOURARCH\client_win_YOURARCH.exe` on Windows from
either the main directory or the bin directory.

In case of problems, delete contents of your OF home directory
(`$HOME/.octaforge` on Unix-like operating systems, `Documents\My Games\OctaForge` on Windows)

If the problem persists, report it into our
