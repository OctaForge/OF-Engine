Compiling OctaForge
********************

Officially supported platforms for OctaForge (those which include/will include
binaries) are currently Linux, FreeBSD, Windows and OS X (experimental).

It should work without problems also on Solaris and other UNIX-like or UNIX
systems.

For different platforms, compilation instructions might differ a bit, so
separate OSes will be explained separately.

For all OSes
============

1. In all cases, you need to get source code. 
   You can use either release tarball or Git source versioning system to get
   source code.
   (Git will get you most recent source)

   There are two locations where you can grab a copy of the repository:

   https://git.octaforge.org/engine/octaforge.git
   https://github.com/OctaForge/OF-Engine

   You can use an arbitrary Git client, Windows users will likely find
   a GUI client such as TortoiseGit more convenient than the command line
   client.

Unix-like systems (including Linux, the BSDs and Mac OS X)
==========================================================

On these OSes compilation should be really trivial. Instructions assume Linux
with deb packaging system, with little modifications it should work everywhere.

Currently this includes OS X. At some point OS X will get its own instructions.

Supported compilers are GCC (at least 4.2), Clang and possibly others.

1. Open terminal window and get some dependencies to build.

   1. build-essential - on Debian, metapackage installing GNU compiler set and
      a few other things. Basically basic things you need to build sources.
   2. SDL2 dev package, SDL2_image dev package, SDL2_mixer dev package
   3. Zlib dev libraries and headers
   4. LuaJIT 2.0 or higher

   For Linux with apt-get:

   sudo apt-get install build-essential zlib1g-dev libluajit-dev libsdl2-dev
   libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-image-dev

   For FreeBSD (compiler and zlib are included by default):

   sudo pkg install sdl20 sdl2_mixer sdl2_image luajit pkgconf gmake

   For other operating systems it should be similar.

   For OS X you can get the official frameworks for the SDL libraries and
   install LuaJIT from Homebrew (or from source). You will need pkg-config
   if you wish to use systemwide LuaJIT.

   If you have a custom build of LuaJIT (static), you can put the lib as
   libluajit.a into src/platform_{linux,freebsd,osx,solaris}/lib and the
   header files into src/platform_*/include and then set LUAJIT_LOCAL in
   the feature section of the Makefile to 1 or pass it to make.

2. Open a terminal, build OF:

   .. code-block :: bash

       $ cd $HOME/OctaForge_source/src
       $ make install

   If you have a multicore processor, you can use -jNUMCORES+1 as make argument.
   On some systems (like FreeBSD), you'll have to use "gmake" instead of "make".
   Add VERBOSE=1 at the end of the make command for verbose builds.

3. You're done, you should have binaries in OFROOT/bin_unix.

Windows
=======

On Windows, fetch the repository https://github.com/OctaForge/OF-Windows and
place the platform_windows directory into src and contents of bin_win32/64
to bin_win32/64.

Then just proceed with the compilation.

OF supports both Win32 and Win64 binaries. The variant is deduced from the
target compiler.

Visual Studio project will be added soon.

So the steps are:

1. Install latest MinGW distribution whichever way you want. You need just the
   core (C/C++ support). You can install it wherever you want, but make sure to
   change steps of this guide accordingly after that. Note that you need
   MinGW64 to build 64bit binaries.

2. Append this into your PATH environment variable. (modify path if needed)

   .. code-block :: bash

       ;C:\mingw\bin

3. Open a cmd, go to OFROOT\src, type

   .. code-block :: bash

       $ mingw32-make install

   If you have a multicore processor, you can use -jNUMCORES+1 as make argument.
   Add VERBOSE=1 at the end of the make command for verbose builds.
