Compiling OctaForge
********************

Officially supported platforms for OctaForge (those which include/will include binaries) are currently Linux, FreeBSD, Windows and Mac OS X.

It should work without problems also on Solaris and other UNIX-like or UNIX systems.

For different platforms, compilation instructions might differ a bit, so separate OSes will be explained separately.

For all OSes
============

1. In all cases, you need to get source code. 
   You can use either release tarball or Git source versioning system to get source code.
   (Git will get you most recent source)

   To get source from Git, use:

   .. code-block :: bash

       $ git clone git://github.com/OctaForge/OF-Engine.git

    To fetch the required dependencies from additional repositories,
    use the submodules and do the following:

    .. code-block :: bash

       $ git submodule init
       $ git submodule update

   It assumes you have Git installed. (http://git-scm.com).
   If you're using Windows, you can use TortoiseGit GUI to make download easier.
   On Mac, you can get packages for example here http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/

   Note that if you use a tarball from git, it won't include required .git directory, so you won't be able
   to fetch the submodules. Because of that, get an archive from octaforge.org, that already contains the
   required submodules.

Linux, BSD, Solaris and other UNIX-like or UNIX systems (excluding Darwin)
==========================================================================

On these OSes compilation should be really trivial.
Instructions assume Linux with deb packaging system,
with little modifications it should work everywhere.

1. Open terminal window and get some dependencies to build.

   .. code-block :: bash

       $ sudo apt-get install build-essential libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev zlib1g-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev

   If I list the dependencies (for other OSes), they are:

   1. build-essential - on Debian, metapackage installing GNU compiler set and a few other things.
      Basically basic things you need to build sources.
   2. SDL dev package, SDL_image dev package, SDL_mixer dev package
   3. Zlib dev libraries and headers
   4. libcurl - pick whatever version you want

2. Open a terminal, build OF:

   .. code-block :: bash

       $ cd $HOME/OctaForge_source/src
       $ make install

   If you have a multicore processor, you can use -jNUMCORES+1 as make argument.
   On some systems (like FreeBSD), you'll have to use "gmake" instead of "make".
   Add VERBOSE=1 at the end of the make command for verbose builds.

3. You're done, you should have binaries in OFROOT/bin_unix.

Windows
=======

On Windows, fetch the repository https://github.com/OctaForge/OF-Windows and place
the platform_windows directory into src and contents of bin_win32/64 to bin_win32/64.

Then just proceed with the compilation.

OF supports both Win32 and Win64 binaries. By default, Win32 binaries are compiled.
If you want to compile Win64 binaries, append another WIN64=1 parameter to mingw32-make.

So the steps are:

1. Install latest MinGW distribution whichever way you want. You need just the core (C/C++ support).
   You can install it wherever you want, but make sure to change steps of this guide accordingly after that.
   Note that you need MinGW64 to build 64bit binaries.

2. Append this into your PATH environment variable. (modify path if needed)

   .. code-block :: bash

       ;C:\mingw\bin

3. Open a cmd, go to OFROOT\src, type

   .. code-block :: bash

       $ mingw32-make install

   If you have a multicore processor, you can use -jNUMCORES+1 as make argument.
   Add VERBOSE=1 at the end of the make command for verbose builds. Add WIN64=1
   for 64bit builds.

Mac OS X (Darwin)
=================

1. You'll need to get some dependencies, first. (I assume you've got OF repository already downloaded)
    1. XCode SDK installed (from Mac OS X DVD or XCode developer DVD).
    2. The needed SDL dmg files - http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-1.2.14.dmg , 
       http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/release/SDL_image-1.2.10.dmg , 
       http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/release/SDL_mixer-1.2.11.dmg
       
       Put the SDL.framework, SDL_mixer.framework and SDL_image.framework from the dmgs to /Library/Frameworks.

2. Go to OF's src directory in the terminal and do

   .. code-block :: bash

       $ make install

   If you have a multicore processor, you can use -jNUMCORES+1 as make argument.
   Add VERBOSE=1 at the end of the make command for verbose builds.

   After everything goes OK, you should have binaries and you can launch (run_client.command file from Finder)
